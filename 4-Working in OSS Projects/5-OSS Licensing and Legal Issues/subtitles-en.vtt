00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.440
We're going to have a brief discussion of open source software licenses and some of the legal issues involved

2
00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.600
and how you determine what kind of license is appropriate for your product.

3
00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.380
There are many kinds of open source software licenses,

4
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.939
but they fall into two general categories restrictive versus permissive.

5
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:25.420
What you choose will depend on both the needs of your project and your philosophy.

6
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.040
In a restrictive license, the software remains open,

7
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.160
but there are strong limitations on any attempt to make closed products which depend on your software.

8
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.980
Any changes to the code actively made available to future recipients in a way they can rebuild their product.

9
00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:48.320
The most prominent example is the GPL, the General Public License from the Free Software Foundation,

10
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.140
which is also known as a copyleft license.

11
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.100
The Linux kernel is released under a GPL license.

12
00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:02.620
Permissive licenses, in general, don't require modifications and enhancements to become generally available,

13
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.780
even if it's used as a proprietary product.

14
00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.800
Prominent examples are the BSD and the Apache licenses.

15
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.120
So, you have to be careful how you choose a license.

16
00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.580
It's a very important decision. It's good to have a thorough discussion early in the development of a project,

17
00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.980
because switching to a different license later can be rather difficult,

18
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:32.220
especially if there are many contributors who have rights and have different opinions about what should happen.

19
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.260
There is a lot of misinformation spread about open source software licenses.

20
00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.420
This falls under the general category of FUD, or Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

21
00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.980
This term actually goes way back as far as the 1920s,

22
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.920
but the FUD acronym seems to first be used in the 1970s.

23
00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:06.740
It means disseminating misinformation to influence people to avoid products and strategies and classes of products by appealing to their fear.

24
00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.840
Microsoft was widely accused of spreading FUD about Linux in the 1990s.

25
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.920
However, most people, but not all, would agree that Microsoft has stopped doing so,

26
00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.440
and it's actually definitely employing open source software widely in their product base today.

27
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:32.560
So, why is the statements that FUD make generally false?

28
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280
A prominent one is that OSS is a virus.

29
00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.900
In other words, if you use any open source software in your product, you will have to open up the source to your entire product.

30
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:50.440
This is not true. Many prominent companies have learned how to both combine open and closed software in their offerings.

31
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.170
There's a lot of experience with this. So, it's really untrue.

32
00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.840
The second one is that open source software infringes on software and patent rights,

33
00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.160
and forces you to give patent rights to others.

34
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.200
Once again, you need proper legal analysis, but it certainly is not generally true.

35
00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:19.300
A third one is that open source products do not offer you help when things break or if you need a technical support.

36
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:27.720
That's absolutely untrue. Many open source products are supported by serious mature long living companies such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux,

37
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.700
as well as many smaller organizations, and there's a lot of freely available

38
00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.400
help online and communities that can support you and help you solve your problems.

39
00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:47.260
And finally, open source software requires a lot of legal help to avoid pitfalls, such as the statements we just discussed,

40
00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.380
and so, therefore, it gets very expensive.
This is nonsense.

41
00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:59.840
Even proprietary software requires significant legal analysis to properly avoid copyright and patent infringement and other problems.

42
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.200
In fact, open source software sometimes makes it easier,

43
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.400
since everybody can see what the actual software is.

44
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.260
You can quickly catch any things which might present legal problems.

45
00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.340
So, no matter what kind of product you have, you'll have to interact with lawyers.

46
00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:24.720
They may be on staff, they may be external, but somebody will have to make sure you're not violating copyrights and licenses.

47
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.440
There are many kinds of licenses.

48
00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:36.370
You should make careful decisions, but once it's put in your DNA of the product, of the project and the product, that's pretty straight forward to respect that.

49
00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.840
Part of this training is making sure developers understand what the do's and don'ts of working with open source software is,

50
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:53.360
So they don't accidentally or ignorantly violate rules and incorporate things in their source, in their product which shouldn't be there.

51
00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.160
So, that's briefly just a few of the issues that are involved in open source licensing.
