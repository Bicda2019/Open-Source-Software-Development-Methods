1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.465
In this module, we will be talking about working in open source projects.

2
00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.180
We'll talk about what is required to be successful and

3
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.050
give examples of long-lived successful projects.

4
00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:18.185
We'll talk about various behaviors you should have,

5
00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.370
you should figure out what itch it is you want to

6
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.300
scratch when you begin working on an open source project.

7
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.060
You should learn to work and play well with others,

8
00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.370
leave your ego at the door,

9
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:30.390
don't take offense if somebody's a little bit nasty,

10
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.840
don't respond in kind and rely on

11
00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.035
more senior members of the community to deal with people like that,

12
00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.120
encourage diversity. You'll be working with people in

13
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.025
projects from all over the world and you have to respect their cultures, etc.

14
00:00:45.025 --> 00:00:48.060
We will have a whole topic on Continuous Integration methods,

15
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:51.510
Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment,

16
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080
methods which are in wide use today to enable

17
00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.950
changes to rapidly propagate all the way to the end user,

18
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.765
sometimes within the day that changes are first proposed and work done.

19
00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:04.290
Finally, we will talk about licensing issues.

20
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.635
We'll talk about the two main classes of licenses,

21
00:01:07.635 --> 00:01:13.610
permissive licenses, such as BSD, and more restrictive licenses, such as the GPL.

22
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.740
We'll talk about the implications you have when you choose a particular license,

23
00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.675
what should be important in your choice of a license,

24
00:01:21.675 --> 00:01:27.240
and we'll have an exercise where you get to do some work on trying to figure that out.
