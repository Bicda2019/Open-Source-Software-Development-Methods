00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.955
Let's continue in this lesson,

2
00:00:01.955 --> 00:00:07.290
in giving some tips for working successfully in an open source project.

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.025
First of all, identify the maintainers, the leadership.

4
00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.885
Study their work and how they operate.

5
00:00:13.885 --> 00:00:16.470
There may be just one basic maintainer,

6
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.424
perhaps, a so-called benevolent dictator.

7
00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:25.220
More likely, there are also subsystem maintainers that handle certain key components.

8
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.610
The Linux kernel is a good model for how that might work.

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.270
The job of a maintainer is to understand and

10
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.480
review everything that is submitted as a patch to the work.

11
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.815
You should make sure that you're not just adding a complication or introducing bugs.

12
00:00:42.815 --> 00:00:45.080
The maintainer also has to make sure

13
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.605
the work doesn't conflict with work submitted by other people,

14
00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:51.620
they have to do their work in a timely manner,

15
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.935
and not leave people impatient or dissatisfied,

16
00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.725
and they have to treat people with respect.

17
00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.030
It's very important to have a good relationship

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.285
with the maintainers you need to deal with.

19
00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:04.325
Be respectful, be patient,

20
00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.660
and also be helpful,

21
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.390
review other people's submissions,

22
00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.290
help debug things, don't just expect service on your own work.

23
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.410
It's important to get input early,

24
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.690
and work out in the open.

25
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.940
Don't go very far without getting some feedback from people,

26
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.230
there's probably a lot of history in the project. Your idea might be an old one.

27
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.860
Perhaps, it was discussed and

28
00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.540
rejected in the past,

29
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.755
but maybe it's worth looking at it again,

30
00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.375
but you should know the history.

31
00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:34.965
A very bad idea suggests to introduce ideas,

32
00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:38.335
and say somebody should do something. That's a good way to be ignored.

33
00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:40.590
People expect you to work on things.

34
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.150
If you can't handle having other people look at your work while you're doing it,

35
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.385
don't work in open source.

36
00:01:47.385 --> 00:01:52.320
It's important to contribute your work in digestible pieces,

37
00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.640
in small meals, not in very large code dumps.

38
00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.500
People get overloaded, and overwhelmed when you give them a lot of code at once and it's

39
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.030
very difficult to test individual parts if a lot of things are done at once.

40
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.190
It's okay if not everything will work until you're done,

41
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.230
people can still digest things bit by bit with the idea in the end it will all work.

42
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.790
Don't be thin skinned,

43
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.210
you may get quite a bit of criticism,

44
00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.700
some of them may be rather blunt and difficult to deal with,

45
00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.755
they may even go over the line and be offensive.

46
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:28.880
If somebody is being offensive,

47
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.780
it's a good idea to rely on members of the community who

48
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.410
have been around for a long time to try to calm things down,

49
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.045
resolve issues, and let them be the one that get rid of trolls if necessary.

50
00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:45.975
It's rare that people have to be removed from a community, but it does happen.

51
00:02:45.975 --> 00:02:49.159
Don't discriminate or offend - this is pretty obvious,

52
00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.055
but it's very unwelcome to do any kind of

53
00:02:52.055 --> 00:02:58.470
discriminatory or offensive conduct with respect to any kind of category such as race,

54
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.385
sex, sexual preference, religion,

55
00:03:01.385 --> 00:03:04.315
national origin, politics, et cetera.

56
00:03:04.315 --> 00:03:07.490
It's very often the case very different people with

57
00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:11.775
very different politics, from all over the world, different religions work together.

58
00:03:11.775 --> 00:03:15.230
This is a great thing and it should not be interfered with.

59
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.580
Be patient! Don't expect everything at once. Long-term relationships will

60
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.530
really pay off. There are contributions which are rejected,

61
00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.930
because somebody just throws them over the fence,

62
00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.710
and leaves and doesn't intend on maintaining them for the future,

63
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:34.420
so even if the work is good, it's unacceptable to include it.

64
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.600
So, that's just a few tips for successfully working in an open source community.
