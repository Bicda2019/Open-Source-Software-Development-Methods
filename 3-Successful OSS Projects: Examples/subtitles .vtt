00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
Open Source Software projects dominate the world's technology infrastructure today.

2
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.960
In this lesson, we will consider some of

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.550
the most successful examples and long-standing examples of open source software projects.

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.510
We begin with the Linux kernel,

5
00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.350
which began in 1991 as Linus Torvalds' student project.

6
00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.790
It has been under an open source license,

7
00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.345
the GPL, since its earliest days.

8
00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:34.440
Almost all the world's computing infrastructure now is based on Linux,

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.735
100 percent of the world's super computers for example,

10
00:00:37.735 --> 00:00:44.825
as well as the largest number of mobile devices since Android is based on Linux,

11
00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:48.205
in fact is Linux in terms of its kernel.

12
00:00:48.205 --> 00:00:52.040
You will find Linux in an enormous range of

13
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.785
devices, such as medical devices, other embedded products,

14
00:00:55.785 --> 00:00:59.610
probably whatever you're using in your home entertainment systems,

15
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.695
as well as personal fitness devices such as Fitbit.

16
00:01:04.695 --> 00:01:07.610
There is a very large and mature development community

17
00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.295
of literally many thousands of developers.

18
00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:12.710
The pace of development is extremely rapid.

19
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.100
New versions come out every 10 to 12 weeks,

20
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.330
and thousands of lines of code are added and removed every single day.

21
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:27.080
The Git distributed version control system arose out of the Linux project in

22
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:33.935
2005, as the project really scaled to thousands of developers in a very frequent pace.

23
00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:36.620
It is specifically designed to work with

24
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.735
a very distributed and far-flung group of contributors.

25
00:01:41.735 --> 00:01:48.940
GitHub, which hosts literally millions of products, is entirely based on Git.

26
00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.080
There's no requirement that you have to have an open source project to use Git.

27
00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.410
It can be used in proprietary projects,

28
00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.760
as well in private repositories.

29
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.970
The Apache Web Server began in 1995.

30
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.170
Today, it's the most widely used web server.

31
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.830
It's produced by the Apache Software Foundation.

32
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.445
Released under the Apache Software License, which has been used by many other projects.

33
00:02:17.445 --> 00:02:23.025
It's a more permissive license than the GPL, which is a so-called restrictive license.

34
00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:26.660
It's very hard to overestimate the importance of Apache.

35
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.340
There are many sub-projects and related projects that are

36
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.570
found in every corner of the international infrastructure for computing.

37
00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.865
Various computer languages are developed using open source techniques.

38
00:02:41.865 --> 00:02:43.780
Languages such as Python,

39
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.930
and Perl, and Ruby,

40
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.675
et cetera, are developed in an open source method.

41
00:02:48.675 --> 00:02:53.580
Languages like C, I should say,

42
00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.360
are developed by international standards bodies, but then

43
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.640
the implementations are developed with open source methods.

44
00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.150
So, for C, for instance,

45
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.840
you have both GCC and the LLVM project releasing compilers.

46
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:14.480
TeX and LaTeX began in 1978 as a project by Donald Knuth,

47
00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.325
who's a very well-known computing science professor,

48
00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:26.490
who is extremely respected for his development of algorithms, as well as TeX system.

49
00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:30.175
It's actually a typesetting system.

50
00:03:30.175 --> 00:03:35.340
It's much more than a word processor, but it's still used to produce many documents,

51
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.705
books, slides, talks, especially in the academic community.

52
00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:43.465
There's an extremely active and very large community,

53
00:03:43.465 --> 00:03:47.290
constantly inventing new extensions to TeX,

54
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.680
as well as international support for languages, et cetera.

55
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:58.590
The Free Software Foundation is in charge of the GNU Project,

56
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.500
or GNU's Not Unix, and many of

57
00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:07.980
the essential ingredients that people use everyday come from the GNU Project,

58
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.220
including gcc - the compiler, the debugger gdb,

59
00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.100
glibc, which is the library that almost all programs have to use,

60
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.620
bash, which is the command line interpreter,

61
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.715
we will talk about in detail later,

62
00:04:21.715 --> 00:04:25.695
and coreutils, as most of the basic command line programs.

63
00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:30.100
System administrators and developers use everyday come from this project.

64
00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.155
Without the GNU Project,

65
00:04:33.155 --> 00:04:38.390
Linux would never have been able to develop at the pace that it did.

66
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.295
The Window and desktop interfaces people are used to using for instance on Linux systems,

67
00:04:46.295 --> 00:04:49.200
as well as other systems,

68
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.795
such as FreeBSD, are developed in an open source manner.

69
00:04:53.795 --> 00:04:58.065
The X Windows System and the desktop environments, GNOME,

70
00:04:58.065 --> 00:05:04.400
KDE, XFCE, and others were all developed using open source methods.

71
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.904
There are many other widely deployed projects

72
00:05:08.904 --> 00:05:12.415
which are developed openly with open source methods.

73
00:05:12.415 --> 00:05:15.770
In particular, OpenStack and Kubernetes are

74
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.920
extremely widely used in very hot projects today.

75
00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.690
Now, we list some of the others,

76
00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.430
such as ONAP for networking,

77
00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.970
Hyperledger for blockchain, et cetera.

78
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:35.600
So, that's just a brief list of a few of the very long number,

79
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:41.400
long list of open source projects that are using the methods we are talking about here.
