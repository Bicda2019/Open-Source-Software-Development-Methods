00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320
So, welcome to the Linux Foundation's introduction

2
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.955
to "Open Source Software Development, Linux and Git" Specialization.

3
00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:13.980
My name is Jerry Cooperstein,

4
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.600
and I am the Training Program Director at The Linux Foundation.

5
00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.880
I won't say much about myself, other than to say that I am,

6
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.550
by training, a theoretical nuclear physicist.

7
00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.260
I've worked with computers as far back as the 1960s,

8
00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:32.230
and I helped set up the training program at The Linux Foundation back in 2009.

9
00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.230
Today, we have grown to a rather large program,

10
00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.579
with a large catalog of courses, both of the instructor-led variety,

11
00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:44.615
virtual courses over the Internet as well, and as well as many e-learning courses.

12
00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:50.515
The Linux Foundation itself is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2000,

13
00:00:50.515 --> 00:00:54.450
and it's the home of Linux creator Linus Torvalds.

14
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.440
Ever since then, it has provided a neutral environment where

15
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.960
Linux kernel development could be protected and accelerated.

16
00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.680
Linux's success catalyzed the growth of

17
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.770
the open source community and demonstrated the commercial efficacy of open source.

18
00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.000
It has sparked countless new projects across

19
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.790
all industries and levels of the world's technology infrastructure.

20
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.770
Today, The Linux Foundation's work extends far beyond Linux,

21
00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.455
fostering innovation at every technology layer.

22
00:01:22.455 --> 00:01:26.120
We partner with the world's leading developers and companies to solve

23
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.790
the most challenging technology problems and

24
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.630
accelerate open technology development and commercial adoption.

25
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.135
Our mission is to provide experience and expertise to any initiative working to solve

26
00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.545
complex problems through open source collaboration,

27
00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.050
supplying the tools to scale open source projects.

28
00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.125
This includes bolstering security, best practices, governance,

29
00:01:49.125 --> 00:01:51.680
operations and ecosystem development,

30
00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.720
and training such as this course.

31
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.760
By doing so, The Linux Foundation has become the umbrella organization for

32
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.285
many critical open source projects that power corporations across all industry sectors.

33
00:02:04.285 --> 00:02:07.040
The introduction to "Open Source Software

34
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.700
Development, Linux and Git" Specialization was created to

35
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.910
provide you with a strong foundation for working

36
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.995
comfortably and productively in open source development communities,

37
00:02:17.995 --> 00:02:21.980
a better understanding of the Linux environment, as well as methods and tools

38
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.060
required to successfully use it and supply training on using Git,

39
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.795
the distributed version control system.

40
00:02:28.795 --> 00:02:32.330
This Specialization is aimed at computer users and

41
00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.815
developers already possessing experience with another operating system.

42
00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:39.410
But who have a more limited knowledge of working in

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.130
a Linux environment, as well as at Linux

44
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.535
users seeking to gain a good working grasp with Git.

45
00:02:45.535 --> 00:02:49.705
The Specialization has been divided into four courses.

46
00:02:49.705 --> 00:02:53.810
The first is "Open Source Software Development Methods".

47
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.250
The second is "Linux for Developers".

48
00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.960
The third is "Linux Tools for Developers".

49
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.515
And the fourth is "Using Git for Distributed Development".

50
00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:05.390
Each course uses several methods to present and

51
00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:09.700
solidify the learning material, including videos, readings,

52
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.865
examples, external resources, lab exercises,

53
00:03:13.865 --> 00:03:17.960
graded and ungraded assessments and discussions, etc.

54
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:22.310
To complete the Specialization and to earn your Specialization certificate,

55
00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.665
you will need to finish all four courses,

56
00:03:25.665 --> 00:03:28.390
obtain a course certificate for each course in

57
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.885
the Specialization and pay for the Specialization.

58
00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.385
Please note there is no "capstone project".

59
00:03:35.385 --> 00:03:38.110
Instead, your newly acquired knowledge and skills will be

60
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.815
assessed based on the graded assignments you submit in each course.

61
00:03:41.815 --> 00:03:45.730
It's required that you pass all of the graded assignments to successfully

62
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.725
complete the individual courses, as well as the entire Specialization.

63
00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:54.860
