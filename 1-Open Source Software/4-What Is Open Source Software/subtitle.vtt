00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.369
The first part of this course is about open source software.

2
00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:10.720
So, the first thing we need to do is talk about what the term means.

3
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.025
Originally, people talked about free software,

4
00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:15.685
but at least in English,

5
00:00:15.685 --> 00:00:19.850
the word "free" and "freedom" has two disparate meanings.

6
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.455
It can mean free, as not limited or controlled,

7
00:00:23.455 --> 00:00:27.980
such as in expressing your freedom of speech and freedom to distribute,

8
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.135
or it can mean free as in no cost or payment.

9
00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:36.850
People often talk about getting "free beer" or "free samples", for example.

10
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:46.810
So in 1998, people began to use the term open source to be clearer about what was meant by freedom.

11
00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.300
If you have open source software,

12
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.510
that generally means that anybody who

13
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.510
respects whatever license is used can examine the software,

14
00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.180
modify it, and redistribute to other people,

15
00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.110
and it doesn't matter who they are,

16
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.940
or exactly what is going to be used for, as long as the license rights are respected.

17
00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.280
There are two basic classifications of licenses.

18
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.225
One is so-called permissive licenses.

19
00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:19.210
BSD is the best known example of that.

20
00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.535
If you make changes to the code and use it in your product,

21
00:01:22.535 --> 00:01:26.240
you do not have to give it to other people that you distribute to.

22
00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.510
This is often preferred by companies, because they're

23
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:35.090
reluctant to give all their changes out to other entities.

24
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.370
A more restrictive license,

25
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.630
the best known example of being the GPL or General Public License from

26
00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.470
the Free Software Foundation, says that any changes to code you

27
00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.565
make, you must make available to all people that receive your product.

28
00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.410
This is sometimes called a Copyleft license.

29
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.130
So, now that we know something

30
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.700
about what the term open source means and how it relates to freedom,

31
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.870
we can move on to get into more details.
