00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:03.780
Any type of project, whether it is open source software or

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.001
not, requires a method of organization, or what we would call a governance model.

3
00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.260
Now, this includes how decisions get made and who makes them.

4
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.419
And this requires careful thought to set it up in a sustainable and efficient way.

5
00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.160
Whether or not anyone can contribute, or only a few people can contribute,

6
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.380
or whether decisions are made democratically, or by some clear central authority,

7
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.814
and whether or not plans and discussions are made public before releases, or

8
00:00:35.814 --> 00:00:38.572
actually put out in the wild,

9
00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:42.448
a project can still be open source, no matter what choices are made for

10
00:00:42.448 --> 00:00:44.220
these parameters.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.160
But these parameters determine what your governance model is.

12
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.620
Now, one model is the company-led process, which is mostly closed, but

13
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.520
the final release is all open source.

14
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.670
So, one entity will control the software design, development and releases.

15
00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.390
There may be external contributions and opinions and review, but

16
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.000
it's not necessary that the company actually take them into account.

17
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.400
Plans and release dates may be described openly or

18
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.290
they may be kept kind of closed and not discussed in advance.

19
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.345
And you may not have a window into internal discussions, controversies and

20
00:01:26.345 --> 00:01:28.260
decisions that are made.

21
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.040
However, once the software is released, it's completely in the open.

22
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.924
A very good example is Google Android, where the source is completely open, but

23
00:01:36.924 --> 00:01:41.587
very little is disclosed to the general public before the release is made.

24
00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:49.122
The benevolent dictatorship model has strong leadership, it has one individual that

25
00:01:49.122 --> 00:01:53.480
makes the final decisions and has overriding influence.

26
00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.580
Whether or not this can work depends on the dictator's wisdom,

27
00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.249
as well as their actual capability and management of the process.

28
00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.250
The role is generally social and political, and not really structural,

29
00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.540
especially if they are using Git as a revision control system.

30
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.670
As things evolve and scale up to larger sizes, the maintainers

31
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.490
will tend to write less and less code and do mostly review.

32
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.640
One advantage of having a strong leadership model is that endless

33
00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.650
discussions can be terminated at the discretion of the so-called dictator.

34
00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.720
I want to point out the word dictator here is not necessarily meant

35
00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.210
in a negative sense, it just means a strong leader.

36
00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.690
The most prominent example, of course, is the Linux kernel led by Linus Torvalds,

37
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.610
Wikipedia is another example.

38
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.538
You can have a completely open process with a governing board, where you

39
00:02:50.538 --> 00:02:53.688
have a tighter control by a smaller group.

40
00:02:53.688 --> 00:03:00.723
All discussions are out in the open, on mailing lists, or chats, or any other form.

41
00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:04.199
And decisions about who contributes, how patches are accepted,

42
00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.950
new software is accepted, are made by that governing body.

43
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.570
There's a lot of variation in the governing structures, from

44
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.630
very loose to very tight.

45
00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.280
Democratic votes versus rule by consensus, etc.

46
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.833
You tend to get less frequent releases, but

47
00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.420
often they're very well debugged hopefully.

48
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.468
So, prominent examples are the FreeBSD operating system or

49
00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:30.477
the Debian Linux distribution.

50
00:03:30.477 --> 00:03:34.211
So that's a brief survey of some of the governance models that are used by

51
00:03:34.211 --> 00:03:36.706
open source software projects.

52
00:03:36.706 --> 00:03:39.970
What you choose will depend on your needs and goals.
