00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.949
We're briefly going to run through the history of open source software.

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:11.855
While the term open source software dates back only to 1998,

3
00:00:11.855 --> 00:00:17.860
the concept of freely sharing the source through various applications, programs,

4
00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.810
hardware device, drivers, et cetera,

5
00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.180
dates back to at least the 1950's in the early years of the computer age.

6
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.204
In the 1950's, most software arose from both corporate and academic environments,

7
00:00:36.204 --> 00:00:39.590
it was often very strongly coupled to the hardware,

8
00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.160
and was generally not distributed by itself,

9
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.130
it was distributed with the binaries.

10
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.870
It wasn't seen as a separate commodity, and licensing was sloppy.

11
00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.130
One reason for the fact that the source was distributed is

12
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.080
that there was many different platforms that people ran on,

13
00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.430
they had different compilers, different operating systems,

14
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.600
and the concept of distributing binaries just was not practical at all.

15
00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.290
In the 1960's, there were rapid advances in computer science,

16
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.280
as well as rapid advances in hardware.

17
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
These developed both in academic institutions,

18
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.900
such as MIT and Berkeley,

19
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.725
and very important early research labs,

20
00:01:23.725 --> 00:01:26.295
particularly Bell Labs and Xerox.

21
00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:32.450
The Internet was born in 1968 with the beginning of ARPANET,

22
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.220
and the Unix operating system began in 1969.

23
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.790
Linux is a direct descendant of Unix.

24
00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.400
In the 1970's, some of the first important open source software projects were released,

25
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.945
some of which still survive today.

26
00:01:50.945 --> 00:01:56.100
Emacs was written by Richard Stallman as a text editor,

27
00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.980
and Richard Stallman has been a very important figure in the history of Open Source.

28
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.830
He's the founder of the Free Software Foundation and the GNU project.

29
00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.475
In 1978, the first version of TeX,

30
00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:14.320
the most advanced typesetting system,

31
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.450
was released by Donald Knuth,

32
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.730
and it's still an extremely wide used and has developed

33
00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.940
into many different forms and many different usages.

34
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.740
The 1980's continued the explosion of

35
00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.075
the Internet and of open source software in general.

36
00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:39.250
There started to be good arenas for widespread discussion online such as Usenet.

37
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.920
The GNU project was announced to provide

38
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.610
alternatives to Unix software that were freely available,

39
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.905
the X Window System which provided

40
00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:52.910
the graphical desktop basis for

41
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.050
almost all Linux distributions until very recently was released,

42
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.474
and then many advances from the Free Software Foundation, including GCC,

43
00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:08.245
the compiler that's used for many languages today on many platforms.

44
00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:12.670
In the 1990's, a student in Finland, Linus Torvalds, asked for

45
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.960
some help in creating a new operating system and that was the birth of Linux.

46
00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.815
The Python language was released in 1992,

47
00:03:22.815 --> 00:03:28.960
other variants of open operating systems, such as 386BSD, were released.

48
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.819
The Debian distribution was begun,

49
00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.240
it was the largest non-commercial Linux distribution and still is,

50
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.500
it has more packages and contributors than any other Linux form,

51
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.315
as well as other kinds of BSD.

52
00:03:45.315 --> 00:03:47.510
Red Hat was released as

53
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.450
the first distribution company to actually succeed as a corporate entity.

54
00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.250
Further later in the decade,

55
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.940
there were many more important products released we still use today,

56
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.590
such as the Ruby language,

57
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:04.930
the Apache web server,

58
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.185
which is the largest market share of web servers in the world,

59
00:04:10.185 --> 00:04:14.110
both the KDE and GNOME desktops are released.

60
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:19.310
The Netscape browser began a pattern that became common later of

61
00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.730
a closed source proprietary platform

62
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.630
releasing its source, so that other people could see it and contribute to it.

63
00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.300
This, of course later, became Firefox, and OpenOffice,

64
00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:33.560
a full featured office suite that was available

65
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.990
across many operating systems eventually was released,

66
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.960
and today it has forked into LibreOffice, which is the form

67
00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.965
that's used on most Linux distributions, if not all.

68
00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:49.525
Then it just continues into the 2000's,

69
00:04:49.525 --> 00:04:55.435
this is just a list of some of the major events, such as the birth of Ubuntu and Firefox.

70
00:04:55.435 --> 00:05:02.185
The Git source control system that we'll talk about in detail later was released in 2005.

71
00:05:02.185 --> 00:05:05.795
Android, which is based on Linux kernel,

72
00:05:05.795 --> 00:05:07.865
was released in 2007,

73
00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:13.260
and today the largest number of phones in the world are based on Android,

74
00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:14.700
and the Chrome browser,

75
00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:17.015
its predecessor was released.

76
00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:19.760
So, that's just a brief review of some of

77
00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.110
the major milestones in the history of open source software.

78
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.530
There are many more that we could have talked about.
