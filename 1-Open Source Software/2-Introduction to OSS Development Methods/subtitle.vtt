00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.990
Let me welcome you to the first course in

2
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.095
our Specialization, "Open Source Development Methods".

3
00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.320
Here, we want to define what open source software is,

4
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.870
let you learn about the history of open source software,

5
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.210
and what benefits it has provided to

6
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.725
the world's technology infrastructure over the decades.

7
00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:26.145
We want to teach you how to work in open source projects productively,

8
00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:27.420
play well with others,

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.940
and be able to gain a lot of benefits from it,

10
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.680
and really see what the advantages are.

11
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.070
We want to discuss the different licensing models that are available,

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.710
and help you decide what the best license is [for your project].

13
00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.745
We want to talk about methods which are in common use,

14
00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:42.805
such as Continuous Integration,

15
00:00:42.805 --> 00:00:44.780
and also the use of GitHub,

16
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.279
and other hosting providers,

17
00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:50.805
as a central meeting place for open source projects.

18
00:00:50.805 --> 00:00:53.935
We want to show you examples of open source projects.

19
00:00:53.935 --> 00:00:57.510
We want to tell you how to encourage diversity in open source projects.

20
00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.925
We just want to survey the whole field.

21
00:00:59.925 --> 00:01:04.370
There will be not many labs here that are actually hands-on exercises,

22
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.545
mostly we will be discussing issues.

23
00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:08.840
In the further courses in this Specialization,

24
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:15.180
we will have very direct hands-on labs with practical experience. So let's begin!
