2
00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:08.186
In this first module, we will talk about open source software,

3
00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:11.480
which is often abbreviated as OSS.

4
00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.310
We will define what it is, and distinguish it from other development models.

5
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.670
We will talk about its history from the earliest days in the computer

6
00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.140
age to its explosion in modern times.

7
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.800
We will talk about how collaborative development works,

8
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.000
how you can build upon the work of others to produce a better product.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
We will talk about how you can increase the security of your project by

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
having more eyeballs look at it.

11
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.510
And lead to higher quality at the same time.

12
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.738
And we'll talk about the advantages to different classes of stakeholders

13
00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:44.058
including individual users, businesses, and marketers,

14
00:00:44.058 --> 00:00:48.907
schools from elementary through university, and developers themselves who

15
00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:53.408
will be vastly aided by being able to
share and collaborate with others.
